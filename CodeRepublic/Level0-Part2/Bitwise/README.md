# Bitwise Problems

- Find the number of 1s in the binary representation of a given number.
- Check if the number of 1s in the binary representation of the number is odd or even.
- Write a `void set(int n, int i)` function that sets the i-th bit of the given number n to 1.
- Write a `void reset(int n, int i)` function that resets the i-th bit of the given number n to 0.
- Write a `void flip(int n, int i)` function that flips the i-th bit of the given number n, turning 1 to 0 and 0 to 1.
- Perform a swap operation to interchange the bits at positions i and j of a given number.
- Display the binary representation of the obtained number. Use bitwise operations.
- Reverse the bits of the number, for example, 11110000 -> 00001111.
- Check if the number is a power of 2 or not
