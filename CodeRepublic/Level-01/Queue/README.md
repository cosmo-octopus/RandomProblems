# Queue Class Implementation

Implement the structure of a Queue using the following methods:

- `enqueue()`: Inserts an element at the end of the queue, i.e., at the rear end.
- `dequeue()`: Removes and returns the element at the front end of the queue.
- `front()`: Returns the element at the front end without removing it.
- `rear()`: Returns the element at the rear end without removing it.
- `isEmpty()`: Indicates whether the queue is empty or not.
- `size()`: Returns the size of the queue, i.e., the total number of elements it contains.
