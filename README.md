Coding patterns enhance our “ability to map a new problem to an already known problem.”

## Pattern: Two Pointers

`Description:` This method uses two pointers to traverse an array or a list from different ends or directions.<br>
`Usage:` It’s particularly useful for ordered data structures, where we can make intelligent decisions based on the position of the pointers.

`DS Involved:` Array, String, LinkedList

## Pattern: Island (Matrix Traversal)

`Description:` It involves traversing a matrix to find ‘islands’ or contiguous groups of elements.<br>
`Usage:` It’s generally used in grid-based problems, especially when we need to group connected elements together.

`DS Involved:` Matrix, Queue

## Pattern: Fast & Slow Pointers

`Description:` Also known as Hare & Tortoise algorithm. In this method, two pointers move at different speeds in a data structure.<br>
`Usage:` It is commonly used to detect cycles in a structure, find middle elements, or to solve other specific problems related to linked lists.

`DS Involved:` Array, String, LinkedList

## Pattern: Sliding Window
`Description:` This pattern involves creating a ‘window’ into the data structure and then moving that window around to gather specific information.<br>
`Usage:` Mostly used in array or list-based problems where you need to find a contiguous subset that fulfills certain conditions.

`DS Involved:` Array, String, HashTable
